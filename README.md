# YOLOv8 Object Detection for Garbage Images

## Overview
The YOLOv8 Object Detection for Garbage Images project aims to utilize advanced deep learning techniques to detect and classify various types of garbage items within images. Employing YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 8, a highly efficient and accurate object detection model, this project seeks to enhance waste management processes by automating the identification and sorting of garbage items. Leveraging the "Warp Waste Recycling Plant Dataset" from Kaggle, consisting of over 10,000 annotated images capturing different garbage items, including plastic bottles, cardboard boxes, aluminum cans, and more, the project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in addressing real-world challenges.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project, the "Warp Waste Recycling Plant Dataset," can be accessed on Kaggle at the following URL: [Warp Waste Recycling Plant Dataset](link).

Key components of the dataset include:

- **Images**: Over 10,000 images depicting garbage items in various contexts and lighting conditions.
- **Annotations**: Each image is accompanied by annotations detailing the location and type of garbage items present, serving as ground truth data for training the YOLOv8 model.
