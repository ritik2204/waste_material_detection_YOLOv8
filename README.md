# Yolov8-Object-Detection

## Overview
The YOLO v8 Object Detection for Garbage Images project aims to leverage state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to detect and classify various types of garbage items within images. This project utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 8, a highly efficient and accurate object detection model. The primary dataset used for this project is the "Warp Waste Recycling Plant Dataset" obtained from Kaggle, which comprises more than 10,000 images of different garbage items. These items include plastic bottles, cardboard boxes, aluminum cans, and more. The dataset also includes annotations for each image, specifying the location and type of each garbage item.

Object detection in garbage images holds significant potential for revolutionizing waste management processes. It offers the capability to automate and enhance the sorting and recycling of diverse garbage items. Traditional methods of garbage sorting are often slow, labor-intensive, and prone to errors, leading to incorrect sorting and the contamination of recyclable materials. By employing object detection techniques like YOLO v8, we can potentially enhance the accuracy and efficiency of garbage sorting. This, in turn, can reduce the environmental impact of waste, promote recycling, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

In this project, YOLO v8 is applied to resized images, each with dimensions of 640x640 pixels. The goal is to demonstrate the practical application of YOLO v8 in addressing real-world problems, shedding light on how deep learning can be harnessed to optimize waste management and promote environmental sustainability.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Warp Waste Recycling Plant Dataset," which can be found on Kaggle at the following URL: Warp Waste Recycling Plant Dataset.

The dataset includes the following key components:

Images: Over 10,000 images of garbage items captured in various contexts and lighting conditions.
Annotations: Each image in the dataset is accompanied by annotations specifying the location and type of each garbage item within the image. These annotations serve as ground truth data for training the YOLO v8 model.
