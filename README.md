# YOLOv8 Object Detection for Garbage Images

## Overview
The YOLOv8 Object Detection for Garbage Images project aims to utilize advanced deep learning techniques to detect and classify various types of garbage items within images. Employing YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 8, a highly efficient and accurate object detection model, this project seeks to enhance waste management processes by automating the identification and sorting of garbage items. Leveraging the "Warp Waste Recycling Plant Dataset"
